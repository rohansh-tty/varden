# Varden 

I always had trouble recalling my passwords. I had to make this CLI to generate/save passwords on my local machine. So that I don't have enter another password to get all my account passwords. 

Varden is a simple CLI, that helps you manage your passwords, from generating to updating or even deleting them.
